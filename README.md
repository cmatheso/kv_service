# [kv_service](https://github.com/cmatheso/kv_service)
An example project containing a simple key,value backend service with another test_client service that can talk to it.

# kv_service
For more information please refer to: [/kv_service/README.md](kv_service)
	
# test_client
For more information please refer to: [/test_client/README.md](test_client)

## Future enhancement ideas:
- Testing with different text encodings.
- Migrating packages into a common shared model definition for use between the client/services.
